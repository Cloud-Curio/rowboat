## Create the set of initial agents
Copilot can set up agents for you from scratch.

### Instruct copilot
First, tell it about the initial set of agents that make up your assistant.

Using copilot to create your initial set of agents helps you leverage best practices in formatting agent instructions and connecting agents to each other as a graph, all of which have been baked into copilot.

### Inspect the agents
Once you apply changes, inspect the agents to see how copilot has built them. Specifically, note the Instructions, and Examples in each agent.

### Make changes if needed
Tweak the instructions and examples through the copilot, or generate instructions button, or by manually editing it.
