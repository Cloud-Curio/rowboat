## Create the set of initial agents
Copilot can set up agents for you from scratch.

### Instruct copilot
First, tell it about the initial set of agents that make up your assistant.

Using copilot to create your initial set of agents helps you leverage best practices in formatting agent instructions and connecting agents to each other as a graph, all of which have been baked into copilot.

### Inspect the agents
Once you apply changes, inspect the agents to see how copilot has built them. Specifically, note the Instructions, Examples and Connected Agents in each agent.

Also notice that copilot would likely have created a "Hub" agent that is "connected" to other agents.

### Make changes if needed
Tweak the instructions and examples manually if needed.
